## Building the Worker with a Network Volume

This will store your application on a Runpod Network Volume and
build a light weight Docker image that runs everything
from the Network volume without installing the application
inside the Docker image.

1. [Create a RunPod Account](https://runpod.io?ref=2xxro4sy).
2. Create a [RunPod Network Volume](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/storage).
3. Attach the Network Volume to a Secure Cloud [GPU pod](https://www.runpod.io/console/gpu-secure-cloud).
4. Select a light-weight template such as RunPod Pytorch.
5. Deploy the GPU Cloud pod.
6. Once the pod is up, open a Terminal and install the required
   dependencies. This can either be done by using the installation
   script, or manually.

### Automatic Installation Script

You can run this automatic installation script which will
automatically install all of the dependencies that get installed
manually below, and then you don't need to follow any of the
manual instructions.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiboris/runpod-worker-photomaker/main/scripts/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

You only need to complete the steps below if you did not run the
automatic installation script above.

1. Install InstantID:
```bash
# Clone InstantID Serverless Worker repo to /workspace
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/wikiboris/runpod-worker-photomaker.git
cd runpod-worker-photomaker/src

# Install Ubuntu updates
apt update
apt -y upgrade

# Install git-lfs
apt -y install git-lfs
git lfs install

# Create and activate venv
python3 -m venv /workspace/venv
source /workspace/venv/bin/activate

# Install torch
pip3 install --no-cache-dir torch==2.0.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install xformers
pip3 install --no-cache-dir xformers==0.0.22

# Install RunPod SDK
pip3 install --no-cache-dir runpod

# Install the requirements for InstantID
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Download the checkpoints:
```bash
export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE="/workspace/huggingface-cache/hub"
export TRANSFORMERS_CACHE="/workspace/huggingface-cache/hub"
python3 download_checkpoints.py
```
3. Download antelopev2 models from Huggingface
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/wikiboris/FaceAnalysis models
```

## Building the Docker Image

You can either build this Docker image yourself, your alternatively,
you can use my pre-built image:

```
ashleykza/runpod-worker-photomaker:1.0.11
```

If you choose to build it yourself:

1. Sign up for a Docker hub account if you don't already have one.
2. Build the Docker image and push to Docker hub:
```bash
docker build -t dockerhub-username/runpod-worker-photomaker:1.0.0 -f Dockerfile.Network_Volume .
docker login
docker push dockerhub-username/runpod-worker-photomaker:1.0.0
```
